## Introduction
Hi! I'm Leonardo Mirkin, a passionate data scientist with experience in transforming complex data into actionable insights. My goal is to leverage my analytical skills, and creativity, to solve problems and make data-driven decisions.

### Professional Objectives
I'm looking for opportunities to apply my data analysis skills in a professional environment, where I can contribute to the success of the organization and continue to develop my competencies.

### Summary of Skills and Experience
- **Data Analysis:** Experience in exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and preparation.
- **Data Visualization:** Skilled in creating clear and effective visualizations using tools like Tableau and Power BI.
- **Programming:** Proficient in Python and SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Modeling:** Experience in applying machine learning techniques and predictive models to solve business problems.

## Featured Projects
Here, I showcase five data science projects, each escalating in conceptual complexity and the sophistication of the tools used. Each project starts with a description of the problem addressed, followed by the methodology applied, and concludes with the results obtained. This progression demonstrates my growing expertise as we move from basic data handling to advanced machine learning and big data analysis.

## Study Projects

Welcome to my collection of study projects! Here, you'll find links to various GitHub repositories containing code and Jupyter notebooks I've put together while diving into online courses or just having fun with data. These projects represent my ongoing journey in the world of data analytics and my enthusiasm for continuous learning.

### Projects and Courses

- **[A/B Testing](Study%20Projects/A_B_Testing.ipynb)**: I dug into [A/B Testing] and uncovered some interesting insights using [Python].
- **[Time Series Forecasting](Study%20Projects/Elect_Demand_Pred.ipynb)**: Experimented with different [time series forecasting models] to predict electricity demand. Learned a lot about time series analysis, model evaluation, and the importance of handling seasonality and trend components.
  
These projects are my way of sharing what I've been up to in the realm of data analytics. Feel free to check them out and see what I've learned along the way!
